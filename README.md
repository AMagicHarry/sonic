**Sonic is a fast, lightweight and schema-less search backend. It ingests search texts and identifier tuples, that can then be queried against.**

Sonic can be used as a simple alternative to super-heavy and full-featured search backends such as Elasticsearch in some use-cases. It is capable of normalizing natural language search queries, auto-completing a search query and providing most relevant results for a query.

**üá´üá∑ Crafted in Nantes, France.**

## Features

* **Search terms are stored in collections, organized in buckets**; you may use a single bucket, or a bucket per user on your platform if you need to search in separate graphs.
* **Search results return object identifiers**, that can be resolved from an external database if you need to enrich the search results. This makes Sonic a simple graph storage system, that points to identifier results. Sonic doesn't store any textual data in its graphs.
* **Networked channel interface (Sonic Channel)**, that let you search your stored graphs or manage data ingestion (push in the index, pop from the index, flush a collection, flush a bucket, etc.). The Sonic Channel protocol was designed to be lightweight on resources and simple to integrate with (the protocol is specified in the sections below).
* **Easy-to-use libraries**, that let you connect to Sonic Channel from your apps.

## Limitations

* **Indexed data limits**: Sonic is designed for large search indexes split over thousands of search buckets per collection. An IID (ie. Internal-ID) is stored in the index as a 32 bits number, which allow up to ~4.2 billion objects to be indexed (ie. OID) per bucket. We've observed storage savings of 30% to 40%, which justifies the trade-off on large databases (versus Sonic using 64 bits IIDs).
* **Search query limits**: Sonic Natural Language Processing system (NLP) does not work at the sentence-level, for storage compactness reasons (we keep the FST graph shallow as to reduce time and space complexity). It works at the word-level, and is thus able to search per-word and can predict a word based on user input, though it is unable to predict the next word in a sentence.
* **Interoperability limits**: Sonic Channel protocol is the only way to read and write search entries to the Sonic search index. Sonic does not expose any HTTP API. If you need to access Sonic Channel from an unsupported programming language, you can either [open an issue](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic/issues/new) or look at the reference [node-sonic-channel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sonic-channel) implementation and build it in your target programming language.

## How to use it?

### Installation

Sonic is built in Rust. To install it, either download a version from the [Sonic releases](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic/releases) page, use `cargo install` or pull the source code from `master`.

**Install from source:**

If you pulled the source code from Git, you can build it using `cargo`:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

You can find the built binaries in the `./target/release` directory.

**Install from Cargo:**

You can install Sonic directly with `cargo install`:

```bash
cargo install sonic-server
```

Ensure that your `$PATH` is properly configured to source the Crates binaries, and then run Sonic using the `sonic` command.

**Install from packages:**

Debian & Ubuntu packages are also available. Refer to the _[How to install it on Debian & Ubuntu?](#how-to-install-it-on-debian--ubuntu)_ section.

**Install from Docker Hub:**

You might find it convenient to run Sonic via Docker. You can find the pre-built Sonic image on Docker Hub as [valeriansaliou/sonic](https://hub.docker.com/r/valeriansaliou/sonic/).

First, pull the `valeriansaliou/sonic` image:

```bash
docker pull valeriansaliou/sonic:v1.0.0
```

Then, seed it a configuration file and run it (replace `/path/to/your/sonic/config.cfg` with the path to your configuration file):

```bash
docker run -p 1491:1491 -v /path/to/your/sonic/config.cfg:/etc/sonic.cfg valeriansaliou/sonic:v1.0.0
```

In the configuration file, ensure that:

* `channel.inet` is set to `0.0.0.0:1491` (this lets Sonic Channel be reached from outside the container)

Sonic Channel will be reachable from `tcp://localhost:1491`.

### Configuration

Use the sample [config.cfg](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic/blob/master/config.cfg) configuration file and adjust it to your own environment.

**Available configuration options are commented below, with allowed values:**

### Run Sonic

Sonic can be run as such:

`./sonic -c /path/to/config.cfg`

## Perform searches and manage objects

Both searches and object management (ie. data ingestion) is handled via the Sonic Channel protocol only. As we want to keep things simple with Sonic (similarly to how Redis does), connecting to Sonic Channel is the way to go when you need to interact with the Sonic search database.

Sonic Channel can be accessed via the `telnet` utility from your computer. The very same system is also used by all Sonic Channel libraries (eg. NodeJS).

### Sonic Channel (uninitialized)

* `START <mode>`: select mode to use for connection (either: `search` or `ingest`)

_Issuing any other command ‚Äî eg. `QUIT` ‚Äî in this mode will abort the TCP connection, effectively resulting in a `QUIT` with the `ENDED not_recognized` response._

### Sonic Channel (Search mode)

_The Sonic Channel Search mode is used for querying the search index. Once in this mode, you cannot switch to other modes or gain access to commands from other modes._

**‚û°Ô∏è Available commands:**

* `QUERY`: query database (syntax: `QUERY <collection> <bucket> "<terms>" [LIMIT(<count>)]? [OFFSET(<count>)]?`)
* `SUGGEST`: auto-completes word (syntax: `SUGGEST <collection> <bucket> "<word>"`)
* `PING`: ping server (syntax: `PING`)
* `HELP`: show help (syntax: `HELP [<manual>]?`)
* `QUIT`: stop connection (syntax: `QUIT`)

**‚è© Syntax terminology:**

* `<collection>`: index collection (ie. what you search in, eg. `messages`, `products`, etc.);
* `<bucket>`: index bucket name (ie. user-specific search classifier in the collection if you have any eg. `user-1, user-2, ..`, otherwise use a common bucket name eg. `generic, default, common, ..`);
* `<terms>`: text for search terms (between quotes);
* `<count>`: a positive integer number; set within allowed maximum & minimum limits;
* `<manual>`: help manual to be shown (available manuals: `commands`);

_Notice: the `bucket` terminology may confuse some Sonic users. As we are well-aware Sonic may be used in an environment where end-users may each hold their own search index graph in a given `collection`, we made it possible to manage per-end-user search graphs with `bucket`. If you only have a single index graph per `collection` (most Sonic users will), we advise you use a static generic name for your `bucket`, for instance: `default`._

**‚¨áÔ∏è Search flow example (via `telnet`):**

```bash
T1: telnet sonic.local 1491
T2: Trying ::1...
T3: Connected to sonic.local.
T4: Escape character is '^]'.
T5: CONNECTED <sonic-server v1.0.0>
T6: START search
T7: STARTED
T8: QUERY messages user:0dcde3a6 "valerian saliou" LIMIT(10)
T9: PENDING Bt2m2gYa
T10: EVENT QUERY Bt2m2gYa conversation:71f3d63b conversation:6501e83a
T11: QUERY helpdesk user:0dcde3a6 "gdpr" LIMIT(50)
T12: PENDING y57KaB2d
T13: QUERY helpdesk user:0dcde3a6 "law" LIMIT(50) OFFSET(200)
T14: PENDING CjPvE5t9
T15: PING
T16: PONG
T17: EVENT QUERY CjPvE5t9
T18: EVENT QUERY y57KaB2d article:28d79959
T19: SUGGEST messages user:0dcde3a6 "val"
T20: PENDING z98uDE0f
T21: EVENT SUGGEST z98uDE0f valerian valala
T22: QUIT
T23: ENDED quit
T24: Connection closed by foreign host.
```

_Notes on what happens:_

* **T6:** we enter `search` mode (this is required to enable `search` commands);
* **T8:** we query collection `messages`, in bucket for platform user `user:0dcde3a6` with search terms `valerian saliou` and a limit of `10` on returned results;
* **T9:** Sonic received the query and stacked it for processing with marker `Bt2m2gYa` (the marker is used to track the asynchronous response);
* **T10:** Sonic processed search query of T8 with marker `Bt2m2gYa` and sends 2 search results (those are conversation identifiers, that refer to a primary key in an external database);
* **T11 + T13:** we query collection `helpdesk` twice (in the example, this one is heavy, so processing of results takes more time);
* **T17 + T18:** we receive search results for search queries of T11 + T13 (this took a while!);

### Sonic Channel (Ingest mode)

_The Sonic Channel Ingest mode is used for altering the search index (push, pop and flush). Once in this mode, you cannot switch to other modes or gain access to commands from other modes._

**‚û°Ô∏è Available commands:**

* `PUSH`: Push search data in the index (syntax: `PUSH <collection> <bucket> <object> "<text>"`)
* `POP`: Pop search data from the index (syntax: `POP <collection> <bucket> <object> "<text>"`)
* `COUNT`: Count indexed search data (syntax: `COUNT <collection> [<bucket> [<object>]?]?`)
* `FLUSHC`: Flush all indexed data from a collection (syntax: `FLUSHC <collection>`)
* `FLUSHB`: Flush all indexed data from a bucket in a collection (syntax: `FLUSHB <collection> <bucket>`)
* `FLUSHO`: Flush all indexed data from an object in a bucket in collection (syntax: `FLUSHO <collection> <bucket> <object>`)
* `PING`: ping server (syntax: `PING`)
* `HELP`: show help (syntax: `HELP [<manual>]?`)
* `QUIT`: stop connection (syntax: `QUIT`)

**‚è© Syntax terminology:**

* `<collection>`: index collection (ie. what you search in, eg. `messages`, `products`, etc.);
* `<bucket>`: index bucket name (ie. user-specific search classifier in the collection if you have any eg. `user-1, user-2, ..`, otherwise use a common bucket name eg. `generic, default, common, ..`);
* `<object>`: object identifier that refers to an entity in an external database, where the searched object is stored (eg. you use Sonic to index CRM contacts by name; full CRM contact data is stored in a MySQL database; in this case the object identifier in Sonic will be the MySQL primary key for the CRM contact);
* `<text>`: search text to be indexed (can be a single word, or a longer text; within maximum length safety limits; between quotes);
* `<manual>`: help manual to be shown (available manuals: `commands`);

_Notice: the `bucket` terminology may confuse some Sonic users. As we are well-aware Sonic may be used in an environment where end-users may each hold their own search index graph in a given `collection`, we made it possible to manage per-end-user search graphs with `bucket`. If you only have a single index graph per `collection` (most Sonic users will), we advise you use a static generic name for your `bucket`, for instance: `default`._

**‚¨áÔ∏è Ingest flow example (via `telnet`):**

```bash
T1: telnet sonic.local 1491
T2: Trying ::1...
T3: Connected to sonic.local.
T4: Escape character is '^]'.
T5: CONNECTED <sonic-server v1.0.0>
T6: START ingest
T7: STARTED
T8: PUSH messages user:0dcde3a6 conversation:71f3d63b Hey Valerian
T9: ERR invalid_format(PUSH <collection> <bucket> <object> "<text>")
T10: PUSH messages user:0dcde3a6 conversation:71f3d63b "Hello Valerian Saliou, how are you today?"
T11: OK
T12: COUNT messages user:0dcde3a6
T13: RESULT 43
T14: COUNT messages user:0dcde3a6 conversation:71f3d63b
T15: RESULT 1
T16: FLUSHO messages user:0dcde3a6 conversation:71f3d63b
T17: RESULT 1
T18: FLUSHB messages user:0dcde3a6
T19: RESULT 42
T20: PING
T21: PONG
T22: QUIT
T23: ENDED quit
T24: Connection closed by foreign host.
```

_Notes on what happens:_

* **T6:** we enter `ingest` mode (this is required to enable `ingest` commands);
* **T8:** we try to push text `Hey Valerian` to the index, in collection `messages`, bucket `user:0dcde3a6` and object `conversation:71f3d63b` (the syntax that was used is invalid);
* **T9:** Sonic refuses the command we issued in T8, and provides us with the correct command format (notice that `<text>` should be quoted);
* **T10:** we attempt to push another text in the same collection, bucket and object as in T8;
* **T11:** this time, our push command in T10 was valid (Sonic acknowledges the push commit to the search index);
* **T12:** we count the number of indexed terms in collection `messages` and bucket `user:0dcde3a6`;
* **T13:** there are 43 terms (ie. words) in index for query in T12;
* **T18:** we flush all index data from collection `messages` and bucket `user:0dcde3a6`;
* **T19:** 42 terms have been flushed from index for command in T18;

## How fast & lightweight is it?

Sonic was built for [Crisp](https://crisp.chat/) from the start. As Crisp was growing and indexing more and more search data into a full-text search SQL database, we decided it was time to switch to a proper search backend system. When reviewing Elasticsearch (ELS) and others, we found those were full-featured heavyweight systems that did not scale well with Crisp's freemium-based cost structure.

At the end, we decided to build our own search backend, designed to be simple and lightweight on resources. We did some benchmarks on how Sonic behaves at scale.
