**Sonic is a fast, lightweight and schema-less search backend. It ingests search texts and identifier tuples, that can then be queried against.**

Sonic can be used as a simple alternative to super-heavy and full-featured search backends such as Elasticsearch in some use-cases. It is capable of normalizing natural language search queries, auto-completing a search query and providing most relevant results for a query.

**üá´üá∑ Crafted in Nantes, France.**
